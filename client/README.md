### Encounter Calculator
The Encounter Calculator provides a form from which the user can input pertinent information about an encounter they want to build, including a *Party Level*, *Party Size*, and *Threat Level*. With this information, the app then calulates all possible compositions of Creatures at various levels that can make up an encounter that satisfies these constraints.

The app also provides links to [Archive of Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/) (AoN), a third party website that provides resources, rulings, and data for Pathfinder 2e. Specifically, the app provides a link for the rules of Encounter Building, detailing guidelines for building encounters as well as describing the basis from which the Encounter Calculator calculates encounters. It also provides for each Creature Level calculated for an encounter, a link on AoN to all available creatures for that level, providing a selection of creatures the user can pick from for their calculated encounter. -->
